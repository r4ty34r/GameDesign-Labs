This project is an example Godot project simulating a basketball shot where a user controls the hoop while the ball automatically "shoots" itself. Controls are handled with key inputs WASD
This lab wwas challenging due to handling the recalculation of the balls trajectory to a moving hoop. There is a bug where the ball glitches into its original position after making contact with the basket.
