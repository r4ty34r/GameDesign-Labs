This project is a very simplistic model of implementing a respawn and health feedback system. WHen the player is contacted by the godot robot, a visible modulation signifies damage being taken. Each time damage is taken, the player's position is reset to the starting point and if too much damage is taken, the player "explodes"

Constrols are done with [SPACE] to jump and left and right arrow keys to move.
